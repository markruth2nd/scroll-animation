 ScrollMagic.min.js for animation
  - I found this in the cdnjs.com libraries, I will use the debug indicator as well to help visualise the scrolling. To help combine these two libraries together I will use GSAP.min.js all of which can be found in the cdnjs ScrollMagic library.

  GSAP Library scripts used:
   - TweenLite.min.js
   - TimelineLite.min.js
   - CSSPlugin.min.js is also required in combination to the TweenLite
   - For me to have this animation animate in a certain path I will also require the BezierPlugin.min.js

The plane used for the animation was downloaded from freepnglogos.com  

Background colour which has been pasted in the CSS was copied from https://webgradients.com/
